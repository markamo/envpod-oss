## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make your changes with atomic commits
3. Ensure all checks pass:
   ```bash
   cargo fmt --check
   cargo clippy -- -D warnings
   cargo test
   ```
4. Open a PR against `main` with a clear description

### Code Standards

- **Format:** `cargo fmt` (rustfmt defaults)
- **Lint:** `cargo clippy` with no warnings
- **Test:** `cargo test` must pass. Add tests for new functionality.
- **Commits:** Atomic, descriptive commit messages. One logical change per commit.

### What Makes a Good PR
