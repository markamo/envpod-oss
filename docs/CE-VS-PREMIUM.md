# envpod CE vs Premium

envpod CE is free forever. It gives you kernel-level isolation and governance that no other free tool provides — including 10/10 OWASP Agentic Security coverage.

Premium adds identity, policy intelligence, fleet orchestration, and advanced monitoring for production agent systems.

## Quick Comparison

|---|---|---|
| **Isolation** | Full kernel-level (namespaces, cgroups, seccomp) | Same |
| **Policy engine** | Action tiers (immediate/delayed/staged/blocked) | + OPA/Rego with 7 decision points |
| **Identity** | Pod namespace isolation | + Ed25519/JWT per pod/agent + OIDC/SSO |
| **Health checks** | Single check, auto-restart | + Multi-check, per-service recovery, notifications |
| **Monitoring** | Audit trail + security scan | + Governance scorecard, OTLP export, Grafana |
| **Networking** | DNS filtering, bilateral discovery | + L7 OPA, Tailscale, DoH blocking, sealed mode |
| **Vault** | Encrypted secrets, env injection | + Vault proxy (agent never sees keys) |
| **Fleet** | Manual pod management | + IaC, parallel clone, scale, batch executor |
| **Verification** | jailbreak-test.sh (in-pod) | + `envpod verify` (host-side, stealth, randomized) |
| **Compliance** | OWASP 10/10 at kernel level | + OWASP attestation, NIST AI RMF mapping |

| ASI-01 Goal Hijacking | Prompt screening, action queue | + OPA policy, policy change governance |
| ASI-02 Excessive Capabilities | Action catalog, tier system | + OPA capability checks, privilege escalation |
| ASI-03 Identity Abuse | Namespace isolation | + Ed25519/JWT, OIDC/SSO |
| ASI-04 Code Execution | seccomp-BPF, PID ns, NO_NEW_PRIVS | + OPA tool governance, sealed mode |
| ASI-05 Output Handling | COW filesystem, diff/commit | + OPA commit policy |
| ASI-06 Memory Poisoning | Memory ns, /proc masking | + Sealed mode |

## When to Upgrade

**Stay on CE if you:**
- Run 1-5 pods on your own machine
- Need basic isolation and governance
- Are a solo developer or small team
- Don't need per-agent identity or OPA policies

**Upgrade to Premium if you:**
- Run multiple services per pod (need per-service health recovery)
- Need OPA/Rego policy engine for fine-grained control
- Need agent identity and OIDC/SSO for your team
- Need fleet management (IaC, scale, batch)
- Need compliance reporting (OWASP attestation, NIST mapping)
- Need observability (scorecard, OTLP export, Grafana)
- Need notifications on health failures
- Run agents that request dynamic privileges
